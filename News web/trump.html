<p> WASHINGTON – The FBI on Friday confirmed for the first time that former President Donald Trump was indeed struck in the ear by a bullet during his near-assassination at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13.The statement, which provided no other details, came two days after FBI Director Chris Wray told lawmakers during a congressional hearing that he did not know exactly what had injured Trump.The short statement came amid mounting criticism of federal authorities for not conclusively and publicly determining whether Trump was injured by a high-powered rifle shot fired by 20-year-old shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks - or by shrapnel related to the shooting.Adding to the confusion was the fact that neither the FBI, the lead investigative agency in the shooting, nor the Secret Service would comment on what, exactly, was the cause of Trump’s injury. Trump’s campaign also declined to answer questions about his injury or his condition.The FBI recovered eight cartridges where the gunman was slain, Wray said, suggesting he fired that many shots. A Pennsylvania firefighter attending the rally was struck and killed by a bullet and two other men were injured.But when asked by members of the House Judiciary Committee, Wray gave ambiguous comments about the source of Trump’s injury.
“What struck former President Trump in the ear was a bullet, whether whole or fragmented into smaller pieces, fired from the deceased subject’s rifle,” the agency said in a statement. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment further.A law enforcement source familiar with planning for the Republican Nation Convention told CNN on Sunday there are discussions underway about adding more federal law enforcement agents to post positions in light of the recent shooting. 

However, the perimeter is unlikely to change, the source said, noting preparations for the RNC have been underway for a year and a half. 

The source added that there have been discussions about adding additional security for high-profile GOP members as well. 

The source said events, such as dinners, may be hard to police as they are outside the perimeter associated with the RNC and do not have the same level of security.A law enforcement source familiar with planning for the Republican Nation Convention told CNN on Sunday there are discussions underway about adding more federal law enforcement agents to post positions in light of the recent shooting.
